Starts with:
	ICA.c includes
			main:
				needs matlab interface to bring in data
				arch 1 and arch << both need work
			runica:
				runcia function < mostly done, check and a few fixes

	runicaAux.c includes auxiliary functions for runica function
			spherex:
				needs work, check over 
			sep96:
				a few lines need to be written, possibly even one last matrix manipulation
				also needs matrix dimensions in allocations
			sepout:
				needs work, check over
			wchange:
				needs work, wonder about *angel on last line, check this
				
	pcabigFn.c  include pcabigfn called by the arch's in main
			pcabigFn:
			check frees deff. not enough, make sure you don't free something that is used later
			mostly done, switch dgeev to eig function
			also look at line 157 wr_matrix and convert wr vector to wr_matrix?
			
	matrix_manipulation.h includes many matrix manipulations used through out the program
	
	levelTwoOps.c  - believe all have been tested
					zero_mean and eigSort called from pcabigFn
					didn't see where cosfn was called from
			zero_mean:
				looks done, check frees
			cosFn:
				looks done, check frees
			eigSort:
				looks done
	
	nnclassFn.c  - called at the end of main
			nnclassFn: 
				needs lots of work 
				
				
	Also if you want compile any of the files run
	for example nnclassFn.c
	gcc nnclassFn.c -lm -o nnclassFn
	to run ./nnclassFn
